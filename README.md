# Rep

Just need to count stuff with a tap? That's a rep.

(This is a port of [Rep for iOS](https://github.com/jonfazzaro/rep) and [Android](https://github.com/jonfazzaro/rep-android) to the web.)

### Development

#### Tools

- **Node.js** (recommended latest LTS version)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Testing

The project uses Vitest for testing. To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

### Running the Application


To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, likely on http://localhost:5173 (Vite's default port).

The build output will likely be in the `dist/` directory.
